Give step by step process and code to create a signup page
where a user can register and a login page to 
log in with the details provided during registration
Successful login should redirect to a profile page which
should contain additional details such as age, dob,
contact, etc, The user can update
Flow : Register > Login > Profile

HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files none
of the code must co-exist in the same file.
Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly
no usage of form submission).
CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in
order to maintain page responsiveness.
Use MySql for storing the registered dataand MongoDB for
Storing the details of the user profiles
In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of
simple SQL statements.
The login session should be maintained only using browser
localstorage (Do not use PHP Session)
Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.
There should be these files
login.js
profile.js
register.js
login.php
profile.php
register.php
index.html
profile.html
login.html
register.html
styles.css
